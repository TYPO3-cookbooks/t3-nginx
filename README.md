# Description

A wrapper cookbook for nginx.

# TODO

* Move tests to an own coobkook below `tests/integration/`
* Decide about the different kinds of proxy (with and without SSL?) that this cookbook should implement
* Decide if we really need a fixed template for the vhost, maybe it's too often customized per application?
* Remove `t3-nginx` from main repo
